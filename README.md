# Sorts

This is a library of sorting algorithms. These are not intended to be optimized for use because they are written in python.
That being said, they are meant to be reasonbly optimized such that I could dump them into C/C++ if expedient.
This library will be complete when it has every sort listed on wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm

The purpose is to grasp a better understanding of how sorts work because implementing something teaches in a differnet way
from writing proofs. 
This is a part of my project to implement the sorts, searches and trees on wikipedia. 

Please post any comments, bugs, and/or suggestions for more sorts
